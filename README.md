# WordWebDB_API

WordWebDB_API is a Flask-based API that acts as an intermediary for a PostgreSQL database. It is designed to manage and interact with the WordWebDB, a database for storing phrases, definitions of words, and tracking the frequency of word encounters. It also keeps track of video clips, pages, and visual explorations related to the words being learned. Optionally, also Anki card ids and decks.

Words and phrases and definitions can be manually entered into it from dictionaries and native media, etc. However, this API is designed with the intent of using Generative AI to automatically create enumerated dictionary entries and example sentences for each new word the learner encounteres in native media so that the learner doesn't have to look up words in a dictionary. 

It will work alongside the `AnkiAPI` to automatically generate flashcards and keep track of card ids that contain the word. 

It is intended to work with other applications as well so `object exploration` is an optional field because the learner will have the opportunity to explor objects using generative ai, to generate images, audio, and text to learn more about the object in the target language. These can be turned on or off upon initialization. 

`Story Name` is also an optional field. This database will be integrated with an app that will consolidate words that were encountered in an immersive session in the target language and a story will be generated that contains the words to help consolidate the learning. 

The `Media Excerpts` will feature either video clips or excerpts from stories, or audio, that contain the word in question. 

The `Familiar` field keeps track of whether or not the word has been encountered in an Anki Card if Anki is integrated, and if Anki isn't, whether or not it has been encountered in native media. The reason this is necessary is because the generative AI will be generating definitions for every single word that are needed to understand every single word in the phrase the learner encountered as well as every single word in the definition. The words in the definition may not have been encountered in native media. The words that were generated by the AI but not encountered in Native Media will have `False` for familiar until this word has been encountered in an Anki Card. 

## Features

- Initialize the database from scratch
- Prepare the database for use in applications
- CRUD operations for phrases and definitions
- Track frequency of word encounters
- Manage video clips and pages related to words
- Handle visual explorations of words
- Database of lemmas
  -  each lemma is mapped to its enumerated definitions contained inside of the Database of enumerated definitions
- Database of enumerated definitions
  - Each of the most frequent definitions as defined and determined by the generative AI or in accordance with which definitions were manually supplied by the learner for the lemma inside the Lemmas database are labeled with the name of the lemma plus a subscript from 1 to n.
  - i.e. 
    - <strong>lemma</strong>: super, 
    - <strong>enumerated definitions</strong>: 
      - super<sub>1</sub>: adj; means excellent or very good. 
      - super<sub>2</sub>: adv; to an extreme degree or extremely. 
      - super<sub>3</sub>: prefix; above, over, or beyond.

## Database Schema

### Database of Lemmas

| Lemma | List of Lemma Enumerations | Frequency |
|-------|---------------------------|-----------|
|       |                           |           |

### Database of Enumerated Lemmas

| Enumerated Lemma | Part of Speech | Definition | Example Phrase | Frequency | Story Name | Media Excerpts | Object Exploration Link | Anki Card Ids | Familiar |
|------------------|----------------|------------|----------------|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------|
|                  |                |            |                |           |            |                |                         |               |          |

## Enumerated_Lemmas
 - Centralized Lemma Metadata: Acts as a comprehensive dictionary, storing detailed information about each lemma, including definitions, part of speech, frequency, familiarity, and multimedia references.
 - Familiarity Tracking: Keeps track of whether a lemma is known or familiar to the user, which can be used to tailor learning experiences and prioritize new lemmas.
- Reference for Branch Creation: Serves as the primary source for creating branches. Every lemma and the words in its definitions and example phrases must exist within a branch, ensuring that all necessary vocabulary is covered.

## Branch
 - Hierarchical Structure Management: Defines the structure of branches, representing sequences or hierarchies of lemmas that need to be learned in a specific order.
 - Branch Metadata: Stores metadata about each branch, such as the root node, branch name, and timestamps for creation and updates, providing context and organization.
 - Prerequisite Knowledge Tracking: Ensures that lemmas are learned in the correct order by maintaining hierarchical relationships and prerequisites within each branch, facilitating structured learning.

## BranchNode
 - Node-Level Hierarchy: Represents individual nodes within a branch, linking each node to a specific lemma and establishing parent-child relationships to maintain the hierarchy.
 - Contextual Learning: Provides context for each lemma within the branch, including its definition and part of speech, to facilitate learning within a structured context.
 - Branch Integration: Links nodes to their respective branches and parent nodes, ensuring that the hierarchical structure is maintained and can be navigated efficiently.

## Summary of Interactions
 - Enumerated_Lemmas: Provides the foundational vocabulary and metadata. It is the reference point for definitions and familiarity, motivating the creation of branches.
 - Branch: Organizes the learning process by defining the hierarchical structure and prerequisites for learning lemmas. It ensures that all necessary vocabulary from Enumerated_Lemmas is covered.
 - BranchNode: Implements the detailed structure within each branch, linking to specific lemmas and providing contextual information to facilitate learning.
